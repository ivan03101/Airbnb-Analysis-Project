# Airbnb-Analysis-Project
This project explores an Airbnb dataset for Los Angeles, using MySQL and MySQL Workbench. The goal of the project was to analyze the data and gain insights into how much the top renters in LA are projected to make, as well as which renters had the best reviews.

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis using SQL queries
Visualization of the results using Python and Jupyter Notebook
Results
The analysis of the dataset revealed the following insights:

The top renters in LA are projected to make over $1 million per year on Airbnb
Renters with the best reviews tend to have a higher occupancy rate and charge slightly higher prices compared to the average Airbnb listing in LA
Conclusion
The analysis of the Airbnb dataset for Los Angeles provides valuable insights into the performance of Airbnb listings in the city. The project demonstrates the potential of using SQL and data analysis tools to gain insights into large datasets.

Future Work
Future work on this project could involve:

Expanding the analysis to other cities and regions
Building a predictive model to forecast future Airbnb earnings for hosts
Developing a web-based dashboard to visualize the results of the analysis
